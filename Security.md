# GitHub Repository Security

## Current Configuration:

- At this time I keep the settings at their maximum. This may make it difficult to collaborate with those who have genuine interest.
- This repository is not restricted to be difficult, just to keep out bad actors and those who might try to inject malicious code.

## Open to revision

- If you would like to participate, I do welcome help and suggestions.
- You are also welcome to suggest alterations to the security configuration that will allow it to be more flexible to open assistance.
